# DeepLearning-TensorFlow-Tutorial
A Jupyter Notebook tutorial on Deep Learning with TensorFlow. Here are the steps to run the TensorBoard enhanced deep learning tutorial:
1. Specify the "logs_path" variable in the script file DeepLearningTensorFlowTutorial.py
2. Run "python DeepLearningTensorFlowTutorial.py" from the command-line
3. Once the python file has been run, execute "tensorboard --logdir=run1:your_logs_path --port 6006"
4. Use your web browser to navigate to http://127.0.1.1:6006 to see the TensorBoard
Note: Be sure to replace 'your_logs_path' with the actual path where you want to store logs.
